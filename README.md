#THIS REPOSITORY IS AN OVERVIEW OF APT3090( INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY )
PROFESSOR : Dr.Stanley Githinji 

#Course Overview
The course introduces the core techniques of cryptography around which security and trust can be constructed,
and highlights the implications of using such techniques. It also looks at the entire key management lifecycle, 
and examines the differing requirements and methodologies for managing cryptographic keys of different types. 
The course ends by looking at how these techniques are applied in various applications and standards, from VPNs to secure email .

#LAB1 REPORT
This report discusses the implementation of a C++ program that generates two random prime numbers within a user-specified range. 
The program prompts the user to input the range, identifies all prime numbers within that range, and selects two primes randomly. 
These primes can be used for various applications, such as cryptographic key generation.

#LAB2 REPORT
This report details the implementation of an RSA key generation algorithm in C++. RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely used public-key
cryptosystem that allows secure data transmission. This implementation generates two random prime numbers within a specified range and 
computes the public and private keys necessary for encryption and decryption.

#LAB3 REPORT 
RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a public-key encryption algorithm that enables secure
communication. It involves generating a pair of keys: a public key used for encryption and a
private key used for decryption. The security of RSA relies on the computational difficulty of
factoring large prime numbers.

#FINAL PROJECT 
The Credit Card Vault Project aims to develop a secure system for merchants to store and manage 
customers' credit card information. In Phase 1, we identify and categorize sensitive, confidential, 
and public information, define user access levels, and design a database schema in 3NF to ensure data
integrity and minimize redundancy. In Phase 2, we implement the database schema, using AES_ENCRYPT and
AES_DECRYPT for data security, and SHA-2 for password hashing. We also create views to cater to different
user access levels and ensure secure data retrieval. The application is hosted with an SSL certificate for
secure communication, and comprehensive documentation is provided, detailing the source code, key functions,
and the database structure. This project emphasizes data protection, efficient storage, and secure access control.

#RSA OVER TCP PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION OF RSA OVER TCP      
In this project, we developed an RSA algorithm with a 1024-bit key size using Python due to 
its accessibility and user-friendly libraries. The 1024-bit key length was chosen to specify the 
key's security level. We created public and private keys using random numbers and used these 
keys to showcase the encryption and decryption process between Alice and Bob. Distinct 
programs for Alice and Bob were designed to enable secure and encrypted messaging via the 
TCP protocol.
